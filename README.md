# Cloud Computing - Performance - Benchmarking-and-Virtual-Environment-setup-for-Cloud-Computing 

## Overview
This project focuses on performance benchmarking of disk storage and network latency in a cloud environment. It includes automation scripts to run benchmarking tests, collect data, and visualize results using Python's Matplotlib.

This work was done as part of CS553 Cloud Computing (WA1) at Illinois Institute of Technology.

---

## Project Objectives
- Perform disk I/O performance benchmarking using shell scripts.
- Conduct network latency testing between cloud virtual machines.
- Visualize collected data using Matplotlib for analysis.
